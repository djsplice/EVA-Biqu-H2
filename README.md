# EVA Modifications for the Biqu H2 hot end / extruder

These were designed to work with the Mercury One conversion for an Ender 5. I believe there are some updates made to the belt path/attachment and are based on the EVA v2 spec.

## Known Issues
1. I optimized the design for ease of use, meaning it's easy to mount and unmount the H2 from the EVA carriage, and have 3 points of attachment between the carriage and the extruder.

I'd initially only had the extruder mounted by 2 bolts on the top of the extruder, but this wasn't as rigid as it could be.

2. Because of the challenges with bolt clearances between the extruder mounts and the faceplate, the extruder is ever so slightly off center from the faceplate. It's less the .5mm off center, and hasn't caused any problems for me.

3. I had to design a new fan duct because existing mods didn't quite fit correctly for me. The current nozzle design sits very close to the build plate, (a little too close for my comfort) but has about .3mm clearance.

I also found that there are a number of ways to assemble the heat break / nozzle which results in varying distances from the build plate! Depending on how you have yours put together, the fan duct may not have enough clearance... Please verify your installation before you experience a crash.

4. I'm a CAD n000b - I make things that work for me, and by sharing them I hope other find utility in them as well!
